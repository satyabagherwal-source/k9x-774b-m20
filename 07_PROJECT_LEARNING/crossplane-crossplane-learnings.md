- **Issue #7921** (2026-10-22): **RBAC manager doesn't grant `/scale` for XRDs that declare a scale subresource**
  *Symptoms*: ### What happened? Since #7004, XRDs can declare a scale subresource, so I expected users with crossplane-edit/crossplane-admin to be able to `kubectl scale` an XR. I attempted to use `kubectl scale` on an XR and got the following error: ``` ➭ kubectl scale modeldeployment glm -n ml-team --replicas=0 Error from server (Forbidden): modeldeployments.modelplane.ai "glm" is forbidden: User "upbound:user:dalorion" cannot patch resource "modeldeployments/scale" in API group "modelplane.ai" in the namespace "ml-team" ➭ k auth can-i --list -n ml-team | grep -E 'Resources|modeldeployments' Resources                                                                                Non-Resource URLs   Resource Names   Verbs modeldeployments.modelplane.ai/status                                                    []                  []               [get list watch *] modeldeployments.modelplane.ai                                                           []                  []               [get list watch *] ``` However I was able to patch the resource and scale down just fine:  ``` kubectl patch modeldeployment glm -n ml-team --type merge -p '{"spec":{"replicas":0}}' ```  ### How can we reproduce it? 1.

- **Issue #7838** (2026-09-22): **Old revision not demoted for SA**
  *Symptoms*: ### What happened?  When trying to upgrade from v2.3.3 to v2.4.1, the functions and provider pods didn't start up. In all function/provider resources there are events messages like:  ```     Message:               Package runtime health is "False" with message: post establish runtime hook failed for package: cannot apply function package service account: ServiceAccount "function-sequencer" is invalid: metadata.ownerReferences: Invalid value: [{"apiVersion":"pkg.crossplane.io/v1","kind":"FunctionRevision","name":"function-sequencer-77518d1ebbf7","uid":"f866d50b-cddc-4fe6-90c2-462c76ac7cb9","controller":true,"blockOwnerDeletion":true},{"apiVersion":"pkg.crossplane.io/v1","kind":"FunctionRevision","name":"function-sequencer-bdbbc83b7f94","uid":"ca0276a5-0400-482e-972b-8333f8f093a7","controller":true,"blockOwnerDeletion":true}]: Only one reference can have Controller set to true.

### Incident Patch 1: `b1165006` (2026-11-03)
**Commit Message**: fix(composite): don't reconcile an XR we already finished deleting

Once Crossplane removes its finalizer from a deleted XR, another finalizer
can keep the XR around. Crossplane kept reconciling it, deleting it again on
every reconcile. A Pipeline XR ran its pipeline again and changed its Deleting
condition, which triggered another reconcile until the other finalizer was
removed.

Do nothing for a deleted XR that no longer has Crossplane's finalizer.

### Incident Patch 2: `4d9c83b7` (2026-11-03)
**Commit Message**: fix(composite): don't change a deleting XR's Deleting condition every reconcile

A deleting XR was marked Deleting without a message, then again with the
message for its deletion policy. The two conditions differ, so the condition's
transition time changed on every reconcile. The status update that wrote it
triggered another reconcile, so a Pipeline XR kept running its pipeline and a
Foreground XR kept reconciling while they waited for their composed resources.

Mark the XR Deleting once on each deletion path, with that path's message.

### Incident Patch 3: `e54991c0` (2026-11-02)
**Commit Message**: fix(composite): don't return a requeue result with a status update error

When a Foreground XR failed to update its status while waiting for its
composed resources, we returned both RequeueAfter and the error.
controller-runtime ignores the result when there's an error, and logs a
warning about it. Return only the error.

Compare the errors the deletion tests return with cmpopts.EquateErrors,
not just whether there was one.

## 6. Net-New Universal Engineering Rules (Candidates for Master Brain)

## X. composite): don't reconcile an XR we already finished deleting

**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `internal/controller/apiextensions/composite/reconciler.go`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in crossplane/crossplane. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `b1165006`: composite): don't reconcile an XR we already finished deleting. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `internal/controller/apiextensions/composite/reconciler.go`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
		// We already finished deleting this XR. Another finalizer is keeping
		// it around, so there's nothing left for us to do.
		if !slices.Contains(xr.GetFinalizers(), finalizer) {
			log.Debug("Composite resource is waiting for other finalizers to be removed")
