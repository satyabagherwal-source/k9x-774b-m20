- **Issue #7838** (2026-09-22): **Old revision not demoted for SA**
  *Symptoms*: ### What happened?  When trying to upgrade from v2.3.3 to v2.4.1, the functions and provider pods didn't start up. In all function/provider resources there are events messages like:  ```     Message:               Package runtime health is "False" with message: post establish runtime hook failed for package: cannot apply function package service account: ServiceAccount "function-sequencer" is invalid: metadata.ownerReferences: Invalid value: [{"apiVersion":"pkg.crossplane.io/v1","kind":"FunctionRevision","name":"function-sequencer-77518d1ebbf7","uid":"f866d50b-cddc-4fe6-90c2-462c76ac7cb9","controller":true,"blockOwnerDeletion":true},{"apiVersion":"pkg.crossplane.io/v1","kind":"FunctionRevision","name":"function-sequencer-bdbbc83b7f94","uid":"ca0276a5-0400-482e-972b-8333f8f093a7","controller":true,"blockOwnerDeletion":true}]: Only one reference can have Controller set to true. Found "true" in references for FunctionRevision/function-sequencer-77518d1ebbf7 and FunctionRevision/function-sequencer-bdbbc83b7f94 ```  SA already had old revision's `controller: true` ownerRef. New revision added another `controller: true`, which Kubernetes rejects.  ### How can we reproduce it?  Any 2.3.x to 2.4.x upgrade with running functions/providers should raise it.  ### What environment did it happen in? Crossplane version: v2.4.1 

- **Issue #7756** (2026-09-25): **TestConfigurationPullFromPrivateRegistry is failing**
  *Symptoms*: ### What happened?  On https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/pull/7755, we noticed that the e2e test `TestConfigurationPullFromPrivateRegistry` is failing consistently with:  ``` DENIED: Permission 'artifactregistry.repositories.downloadArtifacts' denied on resource  '//artifactregistry.googleapis.com/projects/crossplane-playground/locations/us-west1/repositories/xp-install-test'  (or it may not exist). ```  Example failure in https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/actions/runs/32150003551/job/95753219697?pr=7755  It looks like this test container repository `xp-install-test` in GCP that we use during the e2e tests for validating package pulls from a private repo has been accidentally deleted.  We need to figure out how to restore it or how to migrate it to a more permanent location.  ### How can we reproduce it?  Run any of the `pkg` area e2e tests and `TestConfigurationPullFromPrivateRegistry` will fail.  ### What environment did it happen in?  This is happening across all currently supported crossplane branches (1.20 -> 2.4 and main)

+# Controlled Rollout of Composition Functions (v2)
+
+* Owner: Adam Wolfe Gordon (@adamwg)
+* Reviewers: @negz, @bobh66
+* Status: Draft
+
+## Background
+
+Previously, we proposed [a design][v1] that would allow changes to composition
+functions to be rolled out to composite resources in a controlled fashion by
+allowing compositions to reference a specific function revision and making it
+possible for multiple revisions of a function to be active at once. The
+background section of the original design describes the problem we wish to
+solve.
+
+Though it's not called out explicitly in the original design doc, the underlying
+problem that prevents controlled rollout of composition functions is that both
+compositions and functions can have revisions, and these revisions interact
+(composition revisions call function revisions), but the coupling is loose
+(composition revisions don't refer directly to function revisions). The previous
+design solved the problem by tightening the coupling (allowing composition
+revisions to refer to function revisions explicitly), while this design instead
+removes the coupling altogether (removing the need for function revisions).
+
+This document proposes a new, simpler design to solve the problem, based on the
+following observations:
+
+1. Unlike other package types, functions do not contain resources that get
+   installed in the cluster.
+2. Unlike providers (the other current package type with a runtime component),
+   functions are stateless gRPC servers, not controllers. Multiple instances (of
+   the same or different revisions) will not interfere with one another.
+
+## Goals
+
+From the original design:
+
+* Allow users to progressively roll out changes to functions that compose
+  resources. This solves [crossplane#6139].
+* Maintain current behavior for users who do not wish to roll out function
+  changes progressively.
+
+New for this design:
+
+* Allow users to use arbitrary function packages in their compositions without
+  the need to pre-install the functions (as dependencies or otherwise).
+* Allow mixing of function installation modes.
+
+## Proposal
+
+This document proposes three changes in Crossplane to allow for progressive
+rollout of composition functions:
+
+1. Allow composition pipeline steps to reference functions by OCI reference
+   rather than by Function resource name.
+2. Have the composition revision controller manage functions and function
+   revisions referenced by OCI reference, avoiding the need to pre-install such
+   functions.
+3. To accommodate (2), introduce the concept of "external revisions" for
+   functions.
+
+Note that while this design addresses only composition functions, the pipeline
+and package manager changes apply also to operation functions. Operations do not
+have revisions, so controlled rollout of them is not relevant, but the other
+simplifications in this design are applicable.
+
+### Composition and Operation Changes
+
+We will add a `function` field alongside the `functionRef` field in pipeline
+steps such that functions can be called by supplying an OCI reference rather
+than a reference to an installed `Function` resource:
+
+```yaml
+apiVersion: apiextensions.crossplane.io/v1
+kind: Composition
+metadata:
+  name: example
+spec:
+  compositeTypeRef:
+    apiVersion: custom-api.example.org/v1alpha1
+    kind: AcmeBucket
+  mode: Pipeline
+  pipeline:
+  - step: patch-and-transform
+    function: xpkg.crossplane.io/crossplane-contrib/function-patch-and-transform@sha256:c14068f64cfb2088eec75b1c5cc43425383211b75380b9891f1253b57b3c4fe6
+    input:
+      # Removed for brevity
+```
+
+The `function` field, if given, must contain a fully-qualified OCI reference
+with the version specified by digest. We require digests here rather than tags
+because it makes composition revisions truly immutable: installing the same
+composition revision later or on a different cluster is guaranteed to run the
+same function. It is invalid to provide both `function` and `functionRef`.
+
+When `function` is provided, the composition revision controller will ensure
+that the specified function is running by creating a `FunctionRevision` resource
+for it and a parent `Function` resource with an empty `spec.package` (see the
+package manager section below). The `FunctionRevision`'s name is derived
+deterministically from the OCI reference, so all composition revisions that
+reference the same function version share a single revision. The `Function`'s
+name is derived from the OCI repository in the same way the package manager
+names dependencies, so that functions installed by the package manager and
+functions referenced by OCI reference share a `Function`.
+
+If a matching `FunctionRevision` already exists, the composition revision will
+be added as an owner reference. Similarly, if a matching `Function` already
+exists, it is used as the parent and gets an owner reference. To avoid
+garbage collecting resources

## 6. Net-New Universal Engineering Rules (Candidates for Master Brain)

## X. Merge pull request #6935 from adamwg/awg/update-controlled-rollout-design

**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `design/defunct/one-pager-controlled-rollout-of-composition-functions.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in crossplane/crossplane. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `61172690`: Merge pull request #6935 from adamwg/awg/update-controlled-rollout-design. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `design/defunct/one-pager-controlled-rollout-of-composition-functions.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
* Status: Superseded by [v2]
[v2]: ../one-pager-controlled-rollout-of-composition-functions-v2.md
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```go
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
* Status: Accepted
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `61172690` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
