//! # Custom Component Trait Pattern
//!
//! This example demonstrates using a custom trait instead of the standard `Widget` trait for
//! handling mutable state during rendering. This pattern is useful when you want to implement
//! consistent behavior across multiple widget types without implementing the `Widget` trait for
//! each one.
//!
//! This example runs with the Ratatui library code in the branch that you are currently
//! reading. See the [`latest`] branch for the code which works with the most recent Ratatui
//! release.
//!
//! [`latest`]: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/latest
//!
//! ## When to Use This Pattern
//!
//! - You're building a widget framework or library with custom behavior
//! - You want a consistent API across multiple widget types
//! - You need more control over the render method signature
//! - You're prototyping widget behavior before standardizing on `Widget` or `StatefulWidget`
//!
//! ## Trade-offs
//!
//! **Pros:**
//! - Flexible - you can define custom method signatures
//! - Consistent - enforces the same behavior across widget types
//! - Simple - no need to understand `StatefulWidget` complexity
//!
//! **Cons:**
//! - Non-standard - users must learn your custom API instead of Ratatui's standard traits
//! - Less discoverable - doesn't integrate with Ratatui's widget ecosystem
//! - Limited reuse - can't be used with existing Ratatui functions expecting `Widget`
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! The custom `Component` trait allows widgets to mutate their state directly during rendering
//! by taking `&mut self` instead of `self`. This is similar to the mutable widget pattern but
//! with a custom trait interface.

use ratatui::Frame;
use ratatui::layout::Rect;
use ratatui_state_examples::is_exit_key_pressed;

/// Demonstrates the custom component trait pattern for mutable state management.
///
/// Creates a counter widget using a custom `Component` trait and runs the application loop,
/// updating the counter on each render cycle until the user exits.
fn main() -> color_eyre::Result<()> {
    color_eyre::install()?;
    ratatui::run(|terminal| {
        let mut counter = Counter::default();
        loop {
            terminal.draw(|frame| counter.render(frame, frame.area()))?;
            if is_exit_key_pressed()? {
                break Ok(());
            }
        }
    })
}

/// A custom trait for components that can render themselves while mutating their state.
///
/// This trait provides an alternative to the standard `Widget` trait by allowing components to
/// take `&mut self`, enabling direct state mutation during rendering.
trait Component {
    /// Render the component to the given area of the frame.
    fn render(&mut self, frame: &mut Frame, area: Rect);
}

/// A simple counter component that increments its value each time it's rendered.
///
/// Demonstrates how the custom `Component` trait allows widgets to maintain and mutate
/// their own state during the rendering process.
#[derive(Default)]
struct Counter {
    count: usize,
}

impl Component for Counter {
    fn render(&mut self, frame: &mut Frame, area: Rect) {
        self.count += 1;
        frame.render_widget(format!("Counter: {count}", count = self.count), area);
    }
}

```

### Core Architecture Module: `examples/concepts/state/src/bin/immutable-consuming.rs`
```
//! # Consuming Widget Pattern with Immutable State
//!
//! This example demonstrates implementing the `Widget` trait directly on the widget type,
//! causing it to be consumed when rendered. This was the original pattern in Ratatui and
//! is still commonly used, especially for simple widgets that are created fresh each frame.
//!
//! This example runs with the Ratatui library code in the branch that you are currently
//! reading. See the [`latest`] branch for the code which works with the most recent Ratatui
//! release.
//!
//! [`latest`]: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/latest
//!
//! ## When to Use This Pattern
//!
//! - You're working with existing code that uses this pattern
//! - Your widgets are simple and created fresh each frame
//! - You want maximum compatibility with older Ratatui code
//! - You don't need to reuse widget instances
//!
//! ## Trade-offs
//!
//! **Pros:**
//! - Simple - straightforward implementation
//! - Compatible - works with all Ratatui versions
//! - Familiar - widely used pattern in existing code
//! - No borrowing - no need to manage references
//!
//! **Cons:**
//! - Consuming - widget is destroyed after each render
//! - Inefficient - requires reconstruction for repeated use
//! - Limited reuse - cannot store and reuse widget instances
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! The widget implements `Widget` directly on the owned type, meaning it's consumed
//! when rendered and must be recreated for subsequent renders.

use ratatui::buffer::Buffer;
use ratatui::layout::Rect;
use ratatui::widgets::Widget;
use ratatui_state_examples::is_exit_key_pressed;

/// Demonstrates the consuming widget pattern for immutable state rendering.
///
/// Creates a new counter widget instance each frame, showing how the consuming
/// pattern works with immutable state that's managed externally.
fn main() -> color_eyre::Result<()> {
    color_eyre::install()?;
    ratatui::run(|terminal| {
        let mut count = 0;
        loop {
            terminal.draw(|frame| {
                // Widget is created fresh each time and consumed when rendered
                let counter = Counter::new(count);
                frame.render_widget(counter, frame.area());
            })?;
            // State updates happen outside of widget lifecycle
            count += 1;
            if is_exit_key_pressed()? {
                break Ok(());
            }
        }
    })
}

/// A simple counter widget that displays a count value.
///
/// Implements `Widget` directly on the owned type, meaning the widget is consumed
/// when rendered. The count state is managed externally and passed in during construction.
struct Counter {
    count: usize,
}

impl Counter {
    /// Create a new counter widget with the given count.
    const fn new(count: usize) -> Self {
        Self { count }
    }
}

impl Widget for Counter {
    fn render(self, area: Rect, buf: &mut Buffer) {
        // Widget is consumed here - self is moved, not borrowed
        format!("Counter: {}", self.count).render(area, buf);
    }
}

```

### Core Architecture Module: `examples/concepts/state/src/bin/immutable-function.rs`
```
//! # Function-Based Pattern with Immutable State
//!
//! This example demonstrates using standalone functions for rendering widgets with immutable
//! state. This pattern keeps state management completely separate from widget rendering logic,
//! making it easy to test and reason about.
//!
//! This example runs with the Ratatui library code in the branch that you are currently
//! reading. See the [`latest`] branch for the code which works with the most recent Ratatui
//! release.
//!
//! [`latest`]: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/latest
//!
//! ## When to Use This Pattern
//!
//! - You prefer functional programming approaches
//! - Your rendering logic is simple and doesn't need complex widget hierarchies
//! - You want clear separation between state and rendering
//! - You're building simple UIs or prototyping quickly
//!
//! ## Trade-offs
//!
//! **Pros:**
//! - Simple - easy to understand and test
//! - Pure functions - no side effects in rendering
//! - Flexible - can easily compose multiple render functions
//! - Clear separation - state management is completely separate from rendering
//!
//! **Cons:**
//! - Limited - doesn't integrate with Ratatui's widget ecosystem
//! - Verbose - requires passing state explicitly to every function
//! - No reuse - can't be used with existing Ratatui widget infrastructure
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! The function takes immutable references to both the frame and state, ensuring that
//! rendering is a pure operation that doesn't modify state.

use ratatui::Frame;
use ratatui::layout::Rect;
use ratatui_state_examples::is_exit_key_pressed;

/// Demonstrates the function-based pattern for immutable state rendering.
///
/// Creates a counter state and renders it using a pure function, incrementing the counter
/// in the application loop rather than during rendering.

    color_eyre::install()?;
    ratatui::run(|terminal| {
        let mut counter_state = Counter::default();
        loop {
            terminal.draw(|frame| render_counter(frame, frame.area(), &counter_state))?;
            // State updates happen outside of rendering
            counter_state.increment();
            if is_exit_key_pressed()? {

    }
}

    frame.render_widget(format!("Counter: {}", state.count), area);
}

```

### Core Architecture Module: `examples/concepts/state/src/bin/immutable-shared-ref.rs`
```
//! # Shared Reference Pattern with Immutable State
//!
//! This example demonstrates implementing the `Widget` trait on a shared reference (`&Widget`)
//! with immutable state. This is the recommended pattern for most widgets in modern Ratatui
//! applications, as it allows widgets to be reused without being consumed.
//!
//! This example runs with the Ratatui library code in the branch that you are currently
//! reading. See the [`latest`] branch for the code which works with the most recent Ratatui
//! release.
//!
//! [`latest`]: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/latest
//!
//! ## When to Use This Pattern
//!
//! - You want to reuse widgets across multiple renders
//! - Your widget doesn't need to modify its state during rendering
//! - You want the benefits of Ratatui's widget ecosystem
//! - You're building modern, efficient Ratatui applications
//!
//! ## Trade-offs
//!
//! **Pros:**
//! - Reusable - widget can be rendered multiple times without reconstruction
//! - Efficient - no cloning or reconstruction needed
//! - Standard - integrates with Ratatui's widget ecosystem
//! - Modern - follows current Ratatui best practices
//!
//! **Cons:**
//! - Immutable - cannot modify widget state during rendering
//! - External state - requires external state management for dynamic behavior
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! The widget implements `Widget for &Counter`, allowing it to be rendered by reference
//! while keeping its internal data immutable during rendering.

//! # Render Function Pattern
//!
//! This example demonstrates the simplest approach to handling mutable state - using regular
//! functions that accept mutable state references. This pattern works well for simple applications
//! and prototypes where you don't need the complexity of widget traits.
//!
//! This example runs with the Ratatui library code in the branch that you are currently

//! release.
//!
//! [`latest`]: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/latest
//!
//! ## When to Use This Pattern
//!
//! - Simple applications with minimal state management needs
//! - Prototypes and quick experiments
//! - When you prefer functional programming over object-oriented approaches
//! - Applications where state is naturally managed at the top level
//!
//! ## Trade-offs
//!
//! **Pros:**
//! - Extremely simple - no traits to implement or understand
//! - Direct and explicit - state flow is obvious
//! - Flexible - easy to modify without interface constraints
//! - Beginner-friendly - uses basic Rust concepts
//!
//! **Cons:**
//! - State must be passed through function parameters
//! - Harder to organize as application complexity grows
//! - No encapsulation - state management is scattered
//! - Less reusable than widget-based approaches
//! - Can lead to parameter passing through many layers
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! State is managed at the application level and passed to render functions as needed.
//! This approach works well when state is simple and doesn't need complex organization.

//! # Mutable Widget Pattern
//!
//! This example demonstrates implementing the `Widget` trait on a mutable reference (`&mut T`)

//! [`latest`]: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/latest
//!
//! ## When to Use This Pattern
//!
//! - You have self-contained widgets with their own state
//! - You prefer an object-oriented approach to widget design
//! - Your widget's state is simple and doesn't need complex sharing
//! - You want to encapsulate state within the widget itself
//!
//! ## Trade-offs
//!
//! **Pros:**
//! - Simple and intuitive - state is encapsulated within the widget
//! - Familiar pattern for developers coming from OOP backgrounds
//! - Direct state access without external state management
//! - Works well with Rust's ownership system for simple cases
//!
//! **Cons:**
//! - Can lead to borrowing challenges in complex scenarios
//! - Requires mutable access to the widget, which may not always be available
//! - Less flexible than `StatefulWidget` for shared or complex state patterns
//! - May require careful lifetime management in nested scenarios
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! The widget implements `Widget` for `&mut Self`, allowing it to mutate its internal state
//! during the render call. Each render increments a counter, demonstrating state mutation.

//! # Nested Mutable Widget Pattern
//!
//! This example demonstrates nesting widgets that both need mutable access to their state.

//!
//! [`latest`]: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/latest
//!
//! ## When to Use This Pattern
//!
//! - You have hierarchical widget relationships (parent-child)
//! - Each widget needs to maintain its own distinct state
//! - You prefer the mutable widget pattern over `StatefulWidget`
//! - Widgets have clear ownership of their state
//!
//! ## Trade-offs
//!
//! **Pros:**
//! - Clear hierarchical organization
//! - Each widget encapsulates its own state
//! - Intuitive parent-child relationships
//! - State ownership is explicit
//!
//! **Cons:**
//! - Complex borrowing scenarios can arise
//! - Requires careful lifetime management
//! - May lead to borrow checker issues in complex hierarchies
//! - Less flexible than `StatefulWidget` for state sharing
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! The parent `App` widget contains a child `Counter` widget. Both implement `Widget` for
//! `&mut Self`, allowing them to mutate their respective states during rendering. The parent
//! delegates rendering to the child while maintaining its own state structure.

//! # Nested `StatefulWidget` Pattern
//!
//! This example demonstrates composing multiple `StatefulWidget`s in a parent-child hierarchy.

//!
//! ## When to Use This Pattern
//!
//! - Complex applications with hierarchical state management needs
//! - When you want clean separation between widgets and their state
//! - Building composable widget systems
//! - Applications that need testable, reusable widget components
//!
//! ## Trade-offs
//!
//! **Pros:**
//! - Excellent separation of concerns
//! - Highly composable and reusable widgets
//! - Easy to test individual widgets and their state
//! - Scales well with application complexity
//! - Follows idiomatic Ratatui patterns
//!
//! **Cons:**
//! - More boilerplate code than simpler patterns
//! - Requires understanding of nested state management
//! - State structures can become complex
//! - May be overkill for simple applications
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! The parent `App` widget manages application-level state while delegating specific

### Core Architecture Module: `examples/concepts/state/src/bin/refcell.rs`
```
//! # Interior Mutability Pattern (`RefCell`)
//!
//! This example demonstrates using `Rc<RefCell<T>>` for interior mutability, allowing multiple
//! widgets to share and mutate the same state. This pattern is useful when you need shared
//! mutable state but can't use mutable references due to borrowing constraints.
//!
//! This example runs with the Ratatui library code in the branch that you are currently
//! reading. See the [`latest`] branch for the code which works with the most recent Ratatui
//! release.
//!
//! [`latest`]: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/latest
//!
//! ## When to Use This Pattern
//!
//! - Multiple widgets need to access and modify the same state
//! - You can't use mutable references due to borrowing constraints
//! - You need shared ownership of mutable data
//! - Complex widget hierarchies where state needs to be accessed from multiple locations
//!
//! ## Trade-offs
//!
//! **Pros:**
//! - Allows shared mutable access to state
//! - Works with immutable widget references
//! - Enables complex state sharing patterns
//! - Can be cloned cheaply (reference counting)
//!
//! **Cons:**
//! - Runtime borrow checking - potential for panics if you violate borrowing rules
//! - Less efficient than compile-time borrow checking
//! - Harder to debug when borrow violations occur
//! - More complex than simpler state management patterns
//! - Can lead to subtle bugs if not used carefully
//!
//! ## Important Safety Notes
//!
//! - Only one mutable borrow can exist at a time
//! - Violating this rule will cause a panic at runtime
//! - Always minimize the scope of borrows to avoid conflicts
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! The widget wraps its state in `Rc<RefCell<T>>`, allowing the state to be shared and mutated
//! even when the widget itself is used by value (as required by the `Widget` trait).

### Core Architecture Module: `examples/concepts/state/src/bin/stateful-widget.rs`
```
//! # `StatefulWidget` Pattern (Recommended)
//!
//! This example demonstrates the `StatefulWidget` trait, which is the recommended approach for
//! handling mutable state in Ratatui applications. This pattern separates the widget's rendering
//! logic from its state, making it more flexible and reusable.
//!
//! This example runs with the Ratatui library code in the branch that you are currently
//! reading. See the [`latest`] branch for the code which works with the most recent Ratatui
//! release.
//!
//! [`latest`]: https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/latest
//!
//! ## When to Use This Pattern
//!
//! - Most Ratatui applications (this is the recommended default)
//! - When building reusable widget libraries
//! - When you need clean separation between rendering logic and state
//! - When multiple widgets might share similar state structures
//! - When you want to follow idiomatic Ratatui patterns
//!
//! ## Trade-offs
//!
//! **Pros:**
//! - Clean separation of concerns between widget and state
//! - Reusable - the same widget can work with different state instances
//! - Testable - state and rendering logic can be tested independently
//! - Composable - works well with complex application architectures
//! - Idiomatic - follows Ratatui's recommended patterns
//!
//! **Cons:**
//! - Slightly more verbose than direct mutation patterns
//! - Requires understanding of the `StatefulWidget` trait
//! - State must be managed externally
//!
//! ## Example Usage
//!
//! The widget defines its rendering behavior through `StatefulWidget`, while the state is
//! managed separately. This allows the same widget to be used with different state instances
//! and makes testing easier.

## 6. Net-New Universal Engineering Rules (Candidates for Master Brain)

## X. build(deps): bump crate-ci/typos from 1.51.1 to 1.52.0 (#2905)

**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in ratatui/ratatui. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `77ee1f80`: build(deps): bump crate-ci/typos from 1.51.1 to 1.52.0 (#2905). Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
      - uses: crate-ci/typos@4c8b7f51ca60df14e3c5ca82770dfbbe6c3dae85 # v1.52.0
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
      - uses: crate-ci/typos@7f9d0819ca1c008ade73f4b41fa9d258d48f605b # v1.51.1
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `77ee1f80` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
