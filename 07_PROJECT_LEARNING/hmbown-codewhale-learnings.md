## 2. Multi-Dimensional 8-Axis Investigation & Real Code Patches

### D1: Architecture & Structural Boundaries
- Entry configurations inspected via direct stream: package.json, Cargo.toml, README.md, Dockerfile.
- Evaluated system abstractions and modular contracts.

### Core Architecture Module: `crates/agent-contract/src/worker_profile.rs`
```
//! Worker runtime profile — the per-role capability contract for a CodeWhale
//! worker (#3217, #3211, #3213, and the child-permission-intersection issues
//! #414 / #426 / #1186).
//!
//! This is the **Workflow substrate**: every detached worker — whether launched
//! as an `agent` sub-agent or a Fleet worker — should run under a profile
//! that bounds what it may do (permissions, shell access, tool scope, model
//! route, recursion budget, foreground/background). A child profile is always
//! **derived** from its parent and can never escalate beyond it.
//!
//! Scope: this module defines the contract and the parent→child derivation with
//! tests. `agent` and Fleet worker records now build and persist these
//! profiles so parent-visible worker projections have a single capability
//! contract. Runtime enforcement of every declared field remains incremental
//! follow-up work (#3217).

//!
//! This is the single record every setup step (#3404–#3412) reads and writes so
//! that "configured", "skipped", "verified", and "ready" mean the same thing
//! everywhere. It is persisted as a JSON sidecar (`setup_state.json`) under
//! `$CODEWHALE_HOME`, written atomically through [`crate::persistence`] so it is
//! independent of `config.toml`'s comment-preserving writes and can never leave
//! a half-written file.
//!
//! The record holds two things:
//!
//! 1. A per-[`SetupStep`] [`StepEntry`] (status, required, safe summary,
//!    writing lane version).
//! 2. The constitution-first fields the wizard, the update checkpoint, and
//!    `/constitution` all coordinate on.
//!
//! Readiness is a *derived* property ([`first_run_ready`](SetupState::first_run_ready)
//! / [`update_ready`](SetupState::update_ready)); it is never persisted, so the
//! rules can evolve without a migration.
//!
//! Secrets never appear here: [`StepEntry::result`] is a short human-facing
//! summary (provider name, model id, mode name), never a key.

//! Session tree journal placeholder (issue #5262).

//! every non-header entry carries `id` + `parentId`, the active position is
//! a `leafId`, appending creates a child of the leaf, and branching only
//! moves the leaf — it never rewrites history. This file lands the entry
//! shape that #5262's tree operations hang off of; compaction and
//! branch-summary entry kinds are included as first-class kinds but their
//! *strategies* are deferred.
//!
//! Re-exports the protocol journal as the canonical shape so `protocol` and
//! `core` agree on the wire. `core` adds the `SessionJournal` wrapper that
//! owns the `current_leaf_id` column in `state.threads`.

### Incident Patch 1: `885ef69f` (2026-11-05)
**Commit Message**: fix(app-server): neutralize repository-defined git filter drivers on status reads (P12 slice 2)

GET /v1/workspace/status and the git status detail spawned `git status
--porcelain=v1` with only core.fsmonitor and core.hooksPath disabled, so a
repository-configured clean or process filter executed (observed on native-v36:
filter-clean and filter-process markers written), and a failing process filter
made git exit nonzero so the route silently reported dirty=false with zero counts
on a dirty repository. Status reads now go through Git::status_command, which
enumerates filter drivers with `git config --show-scope` and neutralizes any
driver with a definition in a non-global/system scope (local, worktree, other),
including a local redefinition of a global driver; drivers defined only in the
user's global or system config, such as Git LFS, keep working. If the scoped probe
fails it falls back to the all-scope neutralizer (fail closed). --ignore-submodules
=dirty stops a repo-controlled submodule from running its own drivers. Status runs
once in collect_workspace_status (it ran twice). A git failure no longer reads as
clean: WorkspaceStatusResponse and GitStatusDetailResponse gain
status

### Incident Patch 2: `e9fdd250` (2026-11-05)
**Commit Message**: fix(engine): session loads observe under the shared read lock and create no storage

Since 20f8244aafd every snapshot/checkpoint load took the exclusive
write-admission lock to mint an optional write receipt, which creates the
late-usage sidecar directory and lock leaf, so a pure read wrote to disk and
could fail on read-only storage. Loads now observe the session/checkpoint pair
under the shared, non-creating read lock (with_session_observation, which returns
None for a tombstoned session); an absent lock leaf is read unlocked, and when no
observation can be taken the existing degrade path returns the transcript without
a write receipt (the commit message of 20f8244aafd states receipts are optional).
save/rename/archive/delete/capture_session_write_source/resume_session and the
admitted branches are unchanged, and publish_session_inner still refuses a value
with no captured native producer, so a session loaded without a receipt cannot
publish until a caller captures one under write admission. One behavior
difference: a read no longer runs ledger sync/retirement on a deletion marker; it
returns NotFound and the next writer cleans up. A first-ever save racing a read
before the lock

### Incident Patch 3: `f11f7c42` (2026-11-05)
**Commit Message**: test(engine): fix the 201-round backstop, LRU and RLM batch-pin fixtures

productive_tool_results_do_not_hit_no_user_input_backstop, enforce_lru_capacity_does_not_loop_when_all_threads_are_active (its fixed child id was already terminal in the shared temp-dir sub-agent store from an earlier run; it now uses a unique child name) and rlm::bridge llm_batch_dispatch_pins_configured_child_model are repaired as stale fixtures; no product code, caps or accounting semantics changed.

Verified (local, source only): full workspace nextest run after these edits: 19068 run, 19063 passed, 5 failed (67 -> 37 -> 11 -> 8 -> 5 across the series). Still failing and unresolved, stated plainly: child_host child_cancelled_dispatched_open_keeps_unknown_origin (now 2 vs 1 unpriced turns after the fixture fix) and child_step_timeout (usage receipt settle times out), the auto_review guardian missing-coverage receipt check (2 vs 1), event_capacity_cancelled_repl_child (provider source admission fails with the writer's attempted fixture, reverted), and session_manager late_usage_reads_do_not_create_accounting_storage (product decision: reads now create the sidecar directory since 20f8244aafd).

## 6. Net-New Universal Engineering Rules (Candidates for Master Brain)

## X. app-server): neutralize repository-defined git filter drivers on status reads (P

**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `crates/app-server/src/runtime_api/git.rs`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in codewhale-hq/Codewhale. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `885ef69f`: app-server): neutralize repository-defined git filter drivers on status reads (P12 slice 2). Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `crates/app-server/src/runtime_api/git.rs`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
fn status_sync(workspace: &FsPath, args: &[&str]) -> Result<String, ApiError> {
    let output = Git::status_command(workspace)
        .map_err(|error| ApiError::internal(format!("git is unavailable: {error}")))?
        .args(args)
        .output()
        .map_err(|error| ApiError::internal(format!("failed to run git: {error}")))?;
    if !output.status.success() {
        return Err(ApiError::internal(format!(
            "git {} failed: {}",
            args.first().copied().unwrap_or(""),
            String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stderr).trim()
        )));
    }
    Ok(String::from_utf8_lossy(&output.stdout).into_owned())
}

    /// True when `git status` could not be read: the counts are unknown.
    status_unavailable: bool,
        status_unavailable: status.status_unavailable,
    let mut rows = match status_sync(workspace, &["status", "--porcelain=v1", "-z"]) {
            let porcelain = status_sync(
                match status_sync(
    use codewhale_engine::test_support::{EnvVarGuard, lock_test_env};
        let _env_lock = lock_test_env();
        let global = tempfile::tempdir().unwrap();
        let global_config = global.path().join("gitconfig");
        git(
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
    let mut rows = match run_git_sync(workspace, &["status", "--porcelain=v1", "-z"]) {
            let porcelain = run_git_sync(
                match run_git_sync(
        git(ws, &["config", "filter.up.clean", "tr a-z A-Z"]);
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `885ef69f` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
