## 2. Multi-Dimensional 8-Axis Investigation & Real Code Patches

### D1: Architecture & Structural Boundaries
- Entry configurations inspected via direct stream: package.json, Cargo.toml, README.md, Dockerfile.
- Evaluated system abstractions and modular contracts.

### Core Architecture Module: `crates/agent-contract/src/worker_profile.rs`
```
//! Worker runtime profile — the per-role capability contract for a CodeWhale
//! worker (#3217, #3211, #3213, and the child-permission-intersection issues
//! #414 / #426 / #1186).
//!
//! This is the **Workflow substrate**: every detached worker — whether launched
//! as an `agent` sub-agent or a Fleet worker — should run under a profile
//! that bounds what it may do (permissions, shell access, tool scope, model
//! route, recursion budget, foreground/background). A child profile is always
//! **derived** from its parent and can never escalate beyond it.
//!
//! Scope: this module defines the contract and the parent→child derivation with
//! tests. `agent` and Fleet worker records now build and persist these
//! profiles so parent-visible worker projections have a single capability
//! contract. Runtime enforcement of every declared field remains incremental
//! follow-up work (#3217).

//!
//! This is the single record every setup step (#3404–#3412) reads and writes so
//! that "configured", "skipped", "verified", and "ready" mean the same thing
//! everywhere. It is persisted as a JSON sidecar (`setup_state.json`) under
//! `$CODEWHALE_HOME`, written atomically through [`crate::persistence`] so it is
//! independent of `config.toml`'s comment-preserving writes and can never leave
//! a half-written file.
//!
//! The record holds two things:
//!
//! 1. A per-[`SetupStep`] [`StepEntry`] (status, required, safe summary,
//!    writing lane version).
//! 2. The constitution-first fields the wizard, the update checkpoint, and
//!    `/constitution` all coordinate on.
//!
//! Readiness is a *derived* property ([`first_run_ready`](SetupState::first_run_ready)
//! / [`update_ready`](SetupState::update_ready)); it is never persisted, so the
//! rules can evolve without a migration.
//!
//! Secrets never appear here: [`StepEntry::result`] is a short human-facing
//! summary (provider name, model id, mode name), never a key.

//! Session tree journal placeholder (issue #5262).

//! every non-header entry carries `id` + `parentId`, the active position is
//! a `leafId`, appending creates a child of the leaf, and branching only
//! moves the leaf — it never rewrites history. This file lands the entry
//! shape that #5262's tree operations hang off of; compaction and
//! branch-summary entry kinds are included as first-class kinds but their
//! *strategies* are deferred.
//!
//! Re-exports the protocol journal as the canonical shape so `protocol` and
//! `core` agree on the wire. `core` adds the `SessionJournal` wrapper that
//! owns the `current_leaf_id` column in `state.threads`.

- **Issue #7231** (2026-11-07): **fix(net): go direct when a local proxy disappears**
  *Symptoms*: ## What and why  reqwest snapshots `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `ALL_PROXY` when a client is built, and Codewhale builds its engine HTTP clients once per session. A session started behind a local proxy (Clash, v2rayN, sing-box on `127.0.0.1:…`) therefore kept dialing that port after the proxy was closed: every request failed with a connect error, including requests to providers that need no proxy at all, and the only recovery was restarting Codewhale.  `codewhale_net::proxy::install_loopback_proxy()` installs a `reqwest::Proxy::custom` route for ambient **loopback** proxies:  - `no_proxy()` runs first, so the custom route is the only proxy source. `no_proxy()` clears every proxy registered before it, so the order matters: a request the callback declines cannot fall back to the address reqwest read when the client was built. - A background thread probes each configured loopback proxy on its own port. While a port refuses connections, requests that would use it go direct; when it answers again, proxy routing resumes. A live `HTTP_PROXY` therefore does not keep a dead `HTTPS_PROXY` in the path. - Only a definite `ECONNREFUSED` from every resolved address moves a proxy to direct. A timeout, an fd limit or a resolver failure leaves the previous state alone: routing a session direct on that evidence would put traffic on a network path the operator deliberately avoided. - While the port answers, routing is unchanged: `ALL_PROXY` / `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` precedence, `NO_PROXY

### Incident Patch 1: `549ff01e` (2026-11-07)
**Commit Message**: fix(release): handle Windows cleanup and align kit lock [skip ci]

Strip Windows PowerShell's UTF8 BOM before parsing normal cleanup
receipts. Run the existing bounded exact-private-path cleanup fallback
on failures even when its controller has already exited, verify its
returned path and zero remaining Terminal processes, and retain the
original failure result.

Use Cargo's conservative offline update for the standalone vendored
kit lock: app-server-protocol0.10.3 and its declared chrono edge. Root
Cargo.lock and runtime Rust sources are unchanged from4ba0c656ac9c.

Verified on the frozen4ba+these2paths: existing standalone kit themes
14passed/0failed; surfaces3passed/0failed, both locked/offline with
source unchanged and disk guard retained. Node syntax and diff checks
exit0. Independent review confirms both Windows findings are closed.
Actual PowerShell/Windows execution remains pending finalCI.

Mac4ba CLI build and strict HTTP admission/recovery observations passed;
Linux4ba-equivalent CLI build passed with full4270source invariants.
Those executables retain their exact4ba identity and scope; this commit
is not a claim that they were rebuilt from the later script/kit-lock

### Incident Patch 2: `92c26895` (2026-11-07)
**Commit Message**: docs(changelog): record today's plugin stage and Windows release fixes

Root asked for every change landed today to have a 0.10.3 note. Three
landed without one: 91fd65705a (stages appearing during a registry load
now take the restage checks), 67de548a97 (Windows import floor: ARM64
pairs qualified by the native probe, x64 pairs recorded as documented
contracts) and 549ff01ebb (terminal-clipboard harness BOM and cleanup
fallback, vendored kit lock). Lint, style, test-table, ratchet and website
docs commits change no product behavior and get no entry.

Only these three lines are committed; another session's uncommitted
CHANGELOG text stays in the working copy.

Verified: scripts/sync-changelog.sh --check up to date on the committed
pair.

### Incident Patch 3: `062b885d` (2026-11-08)
**Commit Message**: fix(tui): park the hidden cursor at the focused modal input for IMEs

Refs #2323. Input methods place their candidate and preedit window at
the terminal cursor. With a modal open (for example /config search or
its value editor) the TUI hides the cursor but left it wherever the
frame happened to end, usually the composer underneath, so the Pinyin
candidate window appeared far from the field being typed into.
Committed-text routing was already fixed by f9210a4428; this is the
remaining position half.

When a frame draws no visible cursor, the frame loop now moves the
still-hidden cursor to the top modal's input anchor. ModalView gains
input_anchor() (default None); ConfigView records its search caret or
its editor value caret during render; any other modal falls back to the
bottom-left cell inside its occupied region. Nothing becomes visible;
only the position an IME reads changes.

Verification: the batch's six commits were tested as one change on Boat farm VMs
(Linux x86_64), shipping only `git diff <base> <final>`, so no other
session's uncommitted files took part. cargo test --locked --lib with
filters over config, runtime, engine, app-server, tui and cli on base

## 6. Net-New Universal Engineering Rules (Candidates for Master Brain)

## X. release): handle Windows cleanup and align kit lock [skip ci]

**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `scripts/release/windows-terminal-clipboard.mjs`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in codewhale-hq/Codewhale. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `549ff01e`: release): handle Windows cleanup and align kit lock [skip ci]. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `scripts/release/windows-terminal-clipboard.mjs`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
  receipt.cleanup = JSON.parse((await fs.readFile(path.join(evidence, 'cleanup.json'), 'utf8')).replace(/^\uFEFF/, ''));
    }
    if (receipt.result !== 'passed') {
      try {
        const cleanup = execFileSync('powershell.exe', ['-NoProfile', '-NonInteractive', '-Command',
          '$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"; $terminal = $env:CODEWHALE_CLIPBOARD_TERMINAL; $stopped = @(); foreach ($process in @(Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Path -eq $terminal })) { Stop-Process -InputObject $process -Force; if (!$process.WaitForExit(5000)) { throw "Owned Terminal did not exit" }; $stopped += $process.Id }; $remaining = @(Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Path -eq $terminal }).Count; if ($remaining) { throw "Owned Terminal is still running" }; @{ terminal = $terminal; stopped = $stopped; remaining = $remaining } | ConvertTo-Json -Compress'],
        { env: { ...desktopEnv, CODEWHALE_CLIPBOARD_TERMINAL: terminal }, encoding: 'utf8', timeout: 10_000 });
        receipt.desktop.fallbackCleanup = JSON.parse(cleanup.replace(/^\uFEFF/, ''));
        assert.equal(receipt.desktop.fallbackCleanup.terminal, terminal, 'fallback cleanup used the owned Terminal path');
        assert.equal(receipt.des
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
  receipt.cleanup = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(path.join(evidence, 'cleanup.json'), 'utf8'));
      if (desktop.exitCode === null && desktop.signalCode === null) {
        try {
          const cleanup = execFileSync('powershell.exe', ['-NoProfile', '-NonInteractive', '-Command',
            '$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"; $terminal = $env:CODEWHALE_CLIPBOARD_TERMINAL; $stopped = @(); foreach ($process in @(Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Path -eq $terminal })) { Stop-Process -InputObject $process -Force; if (!$process.WaitForExit(5000)) { throw "Owned Terminal did not exit" }; $stopped += $process.Id }; $remaining = @(Get-Process | Where-Object { $_.Path -eq $terminal }).Count; if ($remaining) { throw "Owned Terminal is still running" }; @{ terminal = $terminal; stopped = $stopped; remaining = $remaining } | ConvertTo-Json -Compress'],
          { env: { ...desktopEnv, CODEWHALE_CLIPBOARD_TERMINAL: terminal }, encoding: 'utf8', timeout: 10_000 });
          receipt.desktop.fallbackCleanup = JSON.parse(cleanup.replace(/^\uFEFF/, ''));
        } catch (error) {
          receipt.desktop.cleanupError = String(error); receipt.result = 'failed'; process.exitCode = 1;
        }
    
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `549ff01e` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
