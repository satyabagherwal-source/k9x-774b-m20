## 2. Multi-Dimensional 8-Axis Investigation & Real Code Patches

### D1: Architecture & Structural Boundaries
- Entry configurations inspected via direct stream: package.json, Cargo.toml, README.md, Dockerfile.
- Evaluated system abstractions and modular contracts.

### Core Architecture Module: `crates/agent-contract/src/worker_profile.rs`
```
//! Worker runtime profile — the per-role capability contract for a CodeWhale
//! worker (#3217, #3211, #3213, and the child-permission-intersection issues
//! #414 / #426 / #1186).
//!
//! This is the **Workflow substrate**: every detached worker — whether launched
//! as an `agent` sub-agent or a Fleet worker — should run under a profile
//! that bounds what it may do (permissions, shell access, tool scope, model
//! route, recursion budget, foreground/background). A child profile is always
//! **derived** from its parent and can never escalate beyond it.
//!
//! Scope: this module defines the contract and the parent→child derivation with
//! tests. `agent` and Fleet worker records now build and persist these
//! profiles so parent-visible worker projections have a single capability
//! contract. Runtime enforcement of every declared field remains incremental
//! follow-up work (#3217).

//! Unified setup-state model for the v0.8.67 constitution-first setup lane
//! (#3403).
//!
//! This is the single record every setup step (#3404–#3412) reads and writes so
//! that "configured", "skipped", "verified", and "ready" mean the same thing
//! everywhere. It is persisted as a JSON sidecar (`setup_state.json`) under
//! `$CODEWHALE_HOME`, written atomically through [`crate::persistence`] so it is
//! independent of `config.toml`'s comment-preserving writes and can never leave
//! a half-written file.
//!
//! The record holds two things:
//!
//! 1. A per-[`SetupStep`] [`StepEntry`] (status, required, safe summary,
//!    writing lane version).
//! 2. The constitution-first fields the wizard, the update checkpoint, and
//!    `/constitution` all coordinate on.
//!
//! Readiness is a *derived* property ([`first_run_ready`](SetupState::first_run_ready)
//! / [`update_ready`](SetupState::update_ready)); it is never persisted, so the
//! rules can evolve without a migration.
//!
//! Secrets never appear here: [`StepEntry::result`] is a short human-facing
//! summary (provider name, model id, mode name), never a key.

//! Session tree journal placeholder (issue #5262).

//! every non-header entry carries `id` + `parentId`, the active position is
//! a `leafId`, appending creates a child of the leaf, and branching only
//! moves the leaf — it never rewrites history. This file lands the entry
//! shape that #5262's tree operations hang off of; compaction and
//! branch-summary entry kinds are included as first-class kinds but their
//! *strategies* are deferred.
//!
//! Re-exports the protocol journal as the canonical shape so `protocol` and
//! `core` agree on the wire. `core` adds the `SessionJournal` wrapper that
//! owns the `current_leaf_id` column in `state.threads`.

### Core Architecture Module: `crates/core/src/prefix_cache.rs`
```
//! Prefix-cache stability manager (inspired by Reasonix's Pillar 1).
//!
//! DeepSeek's automatic prefix caching activates only when the *exact*
//! byte prefix of a request matches the prior request. Any system-prompt
//! drift, tool-list reordering, or message-rewriting busts the cache
//! for every token after the changed byte.
//!
//! This module provides a `PrefixStabilityManager` that:
//!
//! 1. **Fingerprints** the immutable prefix (system prompt + tool specs)
//!    at session start, using SHA-256 for strong collision resistance.
//! 2. **Verifies** the current prefix against the pinned fingerprint before
//!    every request.
//! 3. **Attributes** every change: a header change the engine declared
//!    (`/model`, `/mode`, goal edits, MCP or deferred-tool activation,
//!    session sync) re-pins under a logged reason; an undeclared change is
//!    *drift* — it is recorded and reported, and the original pin stays so
//!    later checks keep counting the miss instead of quietly adopting it.
//! 4. **Emits events** so the TUI can surface stability to the user.
//!
//! The invariant this guards: after session start, system and tools are
//! frozen bytes; history only grows; a miss is allowed only when we log why.
//!
//! ## Three-region model (from Reasonix)
//!
//! ```text
//! ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
//! │ IMMUTABLE PREFIX                        │ ← fixed for session
//! │   system + tool_specs                    │   cache hit candidate
//! ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
//! │ APPEND-ONLY HISTORY                     │ ← grows monotonically
//! │   [assistant₁][tool₁][assistant₂]...    │   preserves prefix of prior turns
//! ├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
//! │ LATEST USER TURN                        │ ← the only new content per request

  *Symptoms*: ### Before you start  - [x] I searched existing issues and this is not a duplicate. 我已搜索过现有 issue。  ### What happened? 发生了什么？  Two costs, both from the same alias, and I am reporting them as two separate questions because they have very different risk profiles.  **1. `curl -fsSL https://codewhale.net/install.sh | sh` downloads the same bytes twice.** The script fetches three files and verifies each one separately:  ```sh download "$release_base/$manifest_asset" "$tmpdir/$manifest_asset" download "$release_base/$cli_asset"      "$tmpdir/codewhale" download "$release_base/$shim_asset"     "$tmpdir/codew" ```  On v0.10.2, `codewhale-linux-x64` and `codew-linux-x64` are both 105.1 MiB (110.3 MB) and carry the same SHA-256, so a fresh Linux x64 install transfers ~210 MiB — and ~257 MiB on Windows x64 — to install one program. Grouping the published manifest by digest gives one digest for three names, on all seven targets:  ``` 28ac984a…  codew-linux-x64  codewhale-linux-x64  codewhale-tui-linux-x64 b7c55e36…  codew-linux-arm64  codewhale-linux-arm64  codewhale-tui-linux-arm64 … (7/7 targets, v0.10.2) ```  **2. It then installs those bytes twice**, as two independent 105.1 MiB files, so the install directory also carries ~210 MiB for one program.  Neither is a surprise on the release side — `release-artifacts.yml` builds the alias asset with `cp` plus a `cmp` self-check ("Materialize codew command alias"), and the `codewhale-tui-*` names are kept so installed v0.9.4 clients can sti

- **Issue #7096** (2026-10-27): **Endpoint identity is keyed to the base URL: opencode-go's 1M window falls back to 128K after the host migration**
  *Symptoms*: ### Before you start  - [x] I searched existing issues and this is not a duplicate. 我已搜索过现有 issue。  ### What happened? 发生了什么？  `/setup` reports a **128K** context window for `opencode-go / deepseek-v4.1-flash`. models.dev documents `limit.context = 1000000` for the same id.  The descriptor still points at the old host:  ``` provider_descriptors.json   opencode-go.base_url = https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1 official docs + models.dev  https://opencode.ai/inference/go/openai/v1 ```  The models.dev row holds the correct 1M limit on disk. It is rejected during catalog merging, because `complete_from` only inherits facts when the lower row's base-URL fingerprint matches the provider roster's. Two hosts produce two fingerprints, nothing is inherited, and the window falls back to `LEGACY_DEEPSEEK_CONTEXT_WINDOW_TOKENS` (128,000).  Both hosts serve the same backend: `zen/go/v1/models` and `inference/go/v1/models` return the same model list, differing only in `created`.      ### Steps to reproduce 复现步骤  1. Run `/setup`, select `opencode-go`, open the model list: `deepseek-v4.1-flash` shows 128K. 2. But models.dev documents 1,000,000 for the same id.  ### Codewhale version 版本  codewhale 0.10.2  ### Where did it happen? 在哪里出现？  TUI (terminal interface)  ### Operating system 操作系统  Linux  ### How did you get Codewhale? 获取方式  Official script (codewhale.net/install.sh)  ### Provider and model 提供商和模型  opencode-go / deepseek-v4.1-flash  ### Terminal and shell 终端  xfce4-terminal  ### codewhale do

### Incident Patch 1: `cf10ca14` (2026-10-28)
**Commit Message**: fix(security): bound MCP catalog revalidation and harden hunk patch parsing

Pre-launch security review 2026-10-27 (two of its findings, plus hygiene):

- mcp: a server-supplied list ttlMs had no floor, so ttlMs 0 made the
  catalog stale on every 5s tick, and revalidation runs discovery while
  holding the MCP pool lock. Any configured server could keep every MCP
  operation waiting. Catalog TTLs are now clamped to at least 60s.
  Still open: running discovery outside the lock, and rate-limiting
  list_changed-driven revalidation.
- runtime_api/git: validated_patch sliced the first byte off each @@
  range token, which panicked on a multi-byte character and fired the
  process panic hook. It now strips the expected -/+ sign and refuses
  anything else as a malformed @@ line.
- .gitignore: ignore private key and certificate files, with an
  exception for the existing test-only fixture key.

Verified: scripts/dev-test.sh runtime_api/git.rs git_ -> 146 tests run:
146 passed (includes git_routes_drive_a_real_workspace_repo and
git_write_preconditions_reject_stale_state); scripts/dev-test.sh mcp.rs
mcp:: -> 405 tests run: 405 passed. No new tests, per repo policy.

### Incident Patch 2: `0e9c5beb` (2026-10-28)
**Commit Message**: fix(sandbox): protect git hooks, git config and .codewhale from sandboxed writes

Security review E5 (codewhale-ops/security/PRE-LAUNCH-REVIEW-20261027.md;
founder-accepted D13, 2026-10-27). In workspace-write mode a sandboxed
command could write .git/hooks/* or .git/config (for example
core.hooksPath), which later runs outside the sandbox on the next git
operation; and .codewhale/ was protected only if it already existed.

- Every writable root now gets `.git/hooks` and `.git/config` as
  read-only subpaths when it holds a git dir; a linked worktree's
  gitdir/commondir roots get their own `hooks` and `config`.
- Workspace roots (cwd and configured writable roots) always protect
  `.codewhale/`, even before it exists. Seatbelt rules work on
  nonexistent paths; their parameter now resolves through the
  canonical parent so /var vs /private/var cannot slip past.
- bwrap can only bind existing paths: prepare_bwrap creates the
  workspace's `.codewhale/` first, and read-only exceptions may now be
  files (`.git/config`), not only directories.
- The seatbelt policy test matched the old single-exclusion text
  exactly; it now checks the root-plus-first-exclusion prefix.

### Incident Patch 3: `7bde7462` (2026-10-28)
**Commit Message**: fix(extension-host): a runtime bwrap cannot execute is a start failure, so auto falls back to Node

On Linux the Native host probe ran `<runtime> --version` inside bwrap and
treated any failure as "no verified OS sandbox", a hard error raised while
preparing the launch, before runtime = "auto"'s Bun-to-Node fallback (which
only covers spawn failures). A runtime that is a script or shim (asdf's bash
shims; the test's #!/bin/sh fake Bun) cannot execute in the sandbox because
its interpreter is not among the Native read grants, and bwrap reports
`bwrap: execvp <runtime>: No such file or directory`. bwrap has already built
its namespaces at that point, so the sandbox is verified: the probe now
accepts that line, the real host spawn fails as an ordinary runtime start
failure, and auto falls back to Node with its existing diagnostic. Explicit
bun or node still never fall back; genuine bwrap failures (namespaces, uid
map, missing binary, timeout) remain hard errors.

Paths: crates/tui/src/extension_host/supervisor.rs (bwrap_probe_verdict, its
doc comment, one assertion added to the existing
missing_verified_sandbox_refuses_native_but_reports_pinned_builtin_exception body)

## 6. Net-New Universal Engineering Rules (Candidates for Master Brain)

## X. security): bound MCP catalog revalidation and harden hunk patch parsing

**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.gitignore`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in codewhale-hq/Codewhale. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `cf10ca14`: security): bound MCP catalog revalidation and harden hunk patch parsing. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.gitignore`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:

# Private keys and certificates never belong in the tree.
*.pem
*.key
*.p12
*.p8
id_rsa*
id_ed25519*
!docs/cloud-facts/fixtures/test-only-signing-key.pem
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `cf10ca14` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
