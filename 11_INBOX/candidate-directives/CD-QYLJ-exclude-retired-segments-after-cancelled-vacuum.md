## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `index_write/src/index/merge_policy.rs`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in paradedb/paradedb. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `831a1ce2`: exclude retired segments after cancelled vacuum. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `index_write/src/index/merge_policy.rs`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
        // VACUUM or another merger can publish metadata changes and then be canceled while
        // this merger holds an older view. Their exclusions disappear on ERROR, so compare
        // full entries to catch both retired segments and updated deletion metadata.
        // The caller holds MergeLock, preventing a new VACUUM from starting during selection.
        let live_entries: HashMap<_, _> = unsafe { metadata.segment_metas().list(None) }
            .into_iter()
            .filter(|entry| entry.xmax() == pg_sys::InvalidTransactionId)
            .map(|entry| (entry.segment_id(), entry))
            .collect();

            .filter(|(segment_id, entry)| {
                    && live_entries.get(segment_id) == Some(entry)
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Induced defect failure mode:
            .filter(|(segment_id, _)| {
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `831a1ce2` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
