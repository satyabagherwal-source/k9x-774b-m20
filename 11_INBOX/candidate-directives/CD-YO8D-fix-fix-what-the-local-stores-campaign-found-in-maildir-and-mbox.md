## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records; DIRECTIVE_OPPOSITION: Contradicts canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant): Opposing directive on 'write': candidate forbids action ('never write') while canonical Rule CANON-003 prescribes it ('always write'); CONTRADICTORY_CLAIM: Directly opposes canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant)
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain B

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `Cargo.lock`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in pimalaya/himalaya. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `c0dd1a77`: fix!: fix what the local stores campaign found in Maildir and mbox. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `Cargo.lock`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
source = "git+https://github.com/pimalaya/io-maildir?rev=01552733c853784514578338f0059e28d4277656#01552733c853784514578338f0059e28d4277656"
source = "git+https://github.com/pimalaya/io-mbox?rev=161d84fb691d6954d15d7e3739793251f499d05f#161d84fb691d6954d15d7e3739793251f499d05f"
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
source = "git+https://github.com/pimalaya/io-maildir?rev=ab6c2829ea7c05b5dbca0eec5f327faaba7ddc31#ab6c2829ea7c05b5dbca0eec5f327faaba7ddc31"
source = "registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"
checksum = "a16f63a47571e7f95d804fdce2ea161bbb8cb0017d74192aea99d477d535b915"
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `c0dd1a77` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
