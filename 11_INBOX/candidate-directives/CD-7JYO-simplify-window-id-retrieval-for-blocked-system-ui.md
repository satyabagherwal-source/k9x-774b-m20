## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `gkd-app/src/androidMain/kotlin/li/gkd/app/matching/AndroidMatchHost.kt`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in gkd-kit/gkd. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `6a64cd72`: simplify window ID retrieval for blocked System UI. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Kotlin data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `gkd-app/src/androidMain/kotlin/li/gkd/app/matching/AndroidMatchHost.kt`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```kotlin
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
                if (systemUiBlocked && eventAppId == systemUi) event.windowId else null
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```kotlin
// Induced defect failure mode:
                if (systemUiBlocked && eventAppId == systemUi) event?.windowId else null
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `6a64cd72` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
