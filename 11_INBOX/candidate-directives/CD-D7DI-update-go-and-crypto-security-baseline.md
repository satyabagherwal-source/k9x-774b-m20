## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `STAGED_FOR_REVIEW`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Quarantined for review: Incomplete rule definition or ungrounded evidence ()
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain G

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `go.mod`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in argoproj/argo-events. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `ca9817ff`: deps): update Go and crypto security baseline. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `go.mod`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
	golang.org/x/crypto v0.58.1-0.20261009181718-2f1f834330b2
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```go
// Induced defect failure mode:
	golang.org/x/crypto v0.58.0
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `ca9817ff` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
