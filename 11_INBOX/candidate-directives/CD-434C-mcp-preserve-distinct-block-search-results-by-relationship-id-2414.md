## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: DIRECTIVE_OPPOSITION: Contradicts canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant): Opposing directive on 'write': candidate forbids action ('never write') while canonical Rule CANON-003 prescribes it ('always write'); CONTRADICTORY_CLAIM: Directly opposes canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant)
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain J

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `changelog.d/mcp-block-search-identity.fixed.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in Open-Source-Legal/OpenContracts. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `fb260c3e`: mcp): preserve distinct block search results by relationship ID (#2414). Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Python data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `changelog.d/mcp-block-search-identity.fixed.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```python
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
- Preserve distinct MCP block search results with identical previews by exposing and deduplicating on the relationship ID in `opencontractserver/mcp/formatters.py`. Repeated hits for the same relationship still collapse to the first ranked result; blocks without an ID remain distinct.
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```python
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `fb260c3e` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
