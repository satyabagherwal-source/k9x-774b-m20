## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `STAGED_FOR_REVIEW`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Quarantined for review: Incomplete rule definition or ungrounded evidence ()
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain D

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `apps/docs/content/docs/sandboxes/macos.mdx`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in vercel-labs/agent-desktop. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `2f650705`: keep a started sandbox running after its launcher exits. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `apps/docs/content/docs/sandboxes/macos.mdx`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
`start` answers `running` only once the guest answers over SSH. Until then it answers `working`; repeat `sandbox status` before `sandbox exec`. The VM host runs in its own session, so a started sandbox keeps running after the command that started it exits, including when the caller that launched it is later terminated.
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Induced defect failure mode:
`start` answers `running` only once the guest answers over SSH. Until then it answers `working`; repeat `sandbox status` before `sandbox exec`.
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `2f650705` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
