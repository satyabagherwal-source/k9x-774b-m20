## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `STAGED_FOR_REVIEW`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Quarantined for review: Incomplete rule definition or ungrounded evidence ()
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain I

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `docs/configuration/configuration.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in prometheus/prometheus. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `740695f5`: docs: fix STACKIT example key and list Vultr SD in scrape_config. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `docs/configuration/configuration.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
# List of Vultr service discovery configurations.
vultr_sd_configs:
  [ - <vultr_sd_config> ... ]

stackit_sd_configs:
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```go
// Induced defect failure mode:
stackit_sd_config:
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `740695f5` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
