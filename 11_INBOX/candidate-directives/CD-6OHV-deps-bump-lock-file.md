## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain G

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `Cargo.lock`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in dathere/qsv. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `9e86198d`: deps: bump lock file. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `Cargo.lock`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
version = "3.20.4"
checksum = "87a0cf66fd1eb2fb7b822cb78370d82303750809bc6ba855f3f58e517d3238db"
version = "1.11.2"
checksum = "33ef9e3e8154a45c7a95cff4c1299702106ad94062d7bb85fdc5d3a5afd91d45"
version = "1.2.5"
checksum = "20521a903f02b0a573cd6840e9d0a5a0cc043d361fe924092cd70f8556cc9c4a"
version = "4.6.0"
checksum = "096b1dd5ec053c9c2a5a26a93aafeadf73ebcb710ea54dc3151f17a8e20535ef"
version = "0.13.6"
checksum = "8c447be3a2abfa84b2d91680c56600bd6b2873866de27b36ec911be705e291da"
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Induced defect failure mode:
version = "3.20.3"
checksum = "72f5acc6cb2ba439de613abc23857ec3d78374d8ed5ac84e9d11336e87da8649"
version = "1.11.1"
checksum = "4ff2a8126fff0f8c839080d619675a585e61720bb12d2baceae45769fd66f155"
version = "1.2.4"
checksum = "1788edb87fdc09c7e26304471e2f5be8cdefb1b6930d6e3985fc02ff53bf86ee"
version = "4.5.0"
checksum = "8b317ef681e18f6091efbfab532eaf924a135c492d9d0299d0fbfae07e92a39b"
version = "0.13.5"
checksum = "adb6935a6f5c20170eeceb1a3835a49e12e19d792f6dd344ccc76a985ca5a6ca"
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `9e86198d` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
