## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain L

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `cmd/vclusterctl/cmd/login.go`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in loft-sh/vcluster. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `fe70eda6`: cli): deprecate --docker-login instead of reading image pull secrets. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `cmd/vclusterctl/cmd/login.go`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
	_ = loginCmd.Flags().MarkDeprecated("docker-login", "it only works with shared secrets, which were removed in vCluster CLI v0.38")
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```go
// Induced defect failure mode:
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `fe70eda6` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
