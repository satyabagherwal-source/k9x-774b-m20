## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain F

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.changeset/fix-tailwind-unquoted-object-key-range.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in biomejs/biome. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `e3ab04d5`: tailwind): locate classes in unquoted object keys correctly. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.changeset/fix-tailwind-unquoted-object-key-range.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
---
"@biomejs/biome": patch
---

Fixed the location of Tailwind CSS diagnostics reported on unquoted object keys. In `clsx({ shadow: active })`, diagnostics now highlight `shadow` instead of starting one character later at `hadow:`.
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Induced defect failure mode:
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `e3ab04d5` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
