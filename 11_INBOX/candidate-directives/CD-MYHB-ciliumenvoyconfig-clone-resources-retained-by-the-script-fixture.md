## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records; DIRECTIVE_OPPOSITION: Contradicts canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant): Opposing directive on 'write': candidate forbids action ('never write') while canonical Rule CANON-003 prescribes it ('always write'); CONTRADICTORY_CLAIM: Directly opposes canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant)
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain B

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `pkg/ciliumenvoyconfig/script_test.go`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in cilium/cilium. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `3b61ed8f`: ciliumenvoyconfig: clone resources retained by the script fixture. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `pkg/ciliumenvoyconfig/script_test.go`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
// Retain independent snapshots: the reconciler may reuse and modify its
// protobufs after this call returns, outside the fake server's lock.
		rs[resourceKey{kind: listenerKey, name: l.Name}.String()] = proto.Clone(l)
		rs[resourceKey{kind: secretKey, name: s.Name}.String()] = proto.Clone(s)
		rs[resourceKey{kind: routeKey, name: r.Name}.String()] = proto.Clone(r)
		rs[resourceKey{kind: clustersKey, name: c.Name}.String()] = proto.Clone(c)
		rs[resourceKey{kind: endpointsKey, name: e.ClusterName}.String()] = proto.Clone(e)
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```go
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
		rs[resourceKey{kind: listenerKey, name: l.Name}.String()] = l
		rs[resourceKey{kind: secretKey, name: s.Name}.String()] = s
		rs[resourceKey{kind: routeKey, name: r.Name}.String()] = r
		rs[resourceKey{kind: clustersKey, name: c.Name}.String()] = c
		rs[resourceKey{kind: endpointsKey, name: e.ClusterName}.String()] = e
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `3b61ed8f` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
