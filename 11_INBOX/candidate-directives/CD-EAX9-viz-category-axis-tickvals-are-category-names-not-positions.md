## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `CHANGELOG.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in dathere/qsv. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `892e7223`: viz): category-axis tickvals are category names, not positions. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `CHANGELOG.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
- **`viz smart`: category-axis labels no longer land under the wrong bar when the categories look like numbers.** ([#5047](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/pull/5047)) Frequency bars, measure-by-dimension bars, the Top Relationships lollipop and funnels set their axis labels with `tickvals` holding each category's *position* (0, 1, 2…). Plotly.js matches a category-axis tickval against category *names* first, so on an axis of codes like `day_of_week` (`6, 7, 5, …, 0`) the label for position 0 went under category "0", and so on. Hovering a bar showed one value while the axis said another, and labels that collided were dropped. `tickvals` now hold the category values themselves. This needed `Axis::tick_values` to accept strings, so qsv's `plotly` pin moves to `dathere/plotly` rev [`b652677`](https://github.com/dathere/plotly/commit/b652677502d667edb2caa09dc930a6fe294ce3f4). The gallery Data Schematics are regenerated.
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Induced defect failure mode:
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `892e7223` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
