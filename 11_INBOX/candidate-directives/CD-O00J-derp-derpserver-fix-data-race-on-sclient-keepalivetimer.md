## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `derp/derpserver/derpserver.go`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in tailscale/tailscale. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `283569e7`: derp/derpserver: fix data race on sclient.keepAliveTimer. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `derp/derpserver/derpserver.go`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
	// Assign keepAliveTimer before arming it with Reset: its func
	// resets it (in writePending), and Reset is what orders this
	// assignment before the func runs.
	c.keepAliveTimer = c.s.clock.AfterFunc(365*24*time.Hour, c.onKeepAliveTimer)
	c.keepAliveTimer.Reset(keepAliveInterval())
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```go
// Induced defect failure mode:
	c.keepAliveTimer = c.s.clock.AfterFunc(keepAliveInterval(), c.onKeepAliveTimer)
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `283569e7` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
