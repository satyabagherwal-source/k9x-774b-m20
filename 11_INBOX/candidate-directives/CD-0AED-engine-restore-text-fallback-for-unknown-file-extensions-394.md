## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`

- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain H

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `rust/crates/zg-engine/src/domain/source/format.rs`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in zvec-ai/zvec-grep. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `bc175f00`: engine): restore text fallback for unknown file extensions (#394). Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `rust/crates/zg-engine/src/domain/source/format.rs`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
    /// Trusts catalog matches; probes unmatched files for readable text.
            sniff::format(&header, complete, path.extension().is_none()).unwrap_or(Self::Unknown),
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
    /// Trusts catalog matches; probes only unmatched files without a suffix.
        if path.extension().is_some() {
            return Ok(vec![Self::Unknown]);
        }

            sniff::script(&header, complete).unwrap_or(Self::Unknown),
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `bc175f00` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
