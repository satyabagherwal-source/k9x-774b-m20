## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain G

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `CHANGELOG.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in microsoft/agent-governance-toolkit. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `c8939518`: docs(changelog): record the conversation guardian invisible-character fix. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Python data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `CHANGELOG.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```python
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
- **Conversation guardian no longer misses patterns hidden behind invisible characters (#4124).** Zero-width characters, soft hyphens, variation selectors and similar code points inserted inside a word let an escalation or offensive phrase pass the `agent-os` conversation guardian unchanged. The detectors now run over normalized views of each message with those characters removed, so the same phrases are caught at the same scores, while emoji, right-to-left and CJK text score as before.
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```python
// Induced defect failure mode:
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `c8939518` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
