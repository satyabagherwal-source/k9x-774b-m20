## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.github/instructions/tests.instructions.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in pixeltable/pixeltable. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `b907dcb3`: Write the default config atomically and require init_env for tests that reach Env. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Python data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.github/instructions/tests.instructions.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```python
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
- A test that reaches `Env.get()`, directly or through a helper such as `skip_test_if_not_installed()`,
  requests `init_env`; `uses_db` and `db_root` include it. Without it, the test would use whatever an earlier
  test on its xdist worker set up, or the developer's real Pixeltable home and database when it runs first, so
  `tests/conftest.py` fails such a test.
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```python
// Induced defect failure mode:
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `b907dcb3` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
