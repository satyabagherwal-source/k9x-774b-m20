## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in NucleoidAI/Nucleoid. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `41394de4`: Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/NucleoidAI/Nucleoid. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
| [proposals.instructions.md](rules/proposals.instructions.md) | Independent NUC proposal preparation and evaluation, the token policy, automatic acceptance on the hard criteria (no compile errors, every test passing, backward compatibility) with the `Automatic-Accepted` status, ARC- and user-requested bases, the pushed `Draft NUC <number> <Title>` allocation of each new NUC before its details, after a pull that claims the next free number or skips a concept already proposed, continuous cycles that first pick up allocated Drafts idle for 24 hours under a pushed `Resume NUC <number> <Title>` claim, and `NUC <number> <Title>` outcome commit messages |
| [git.instructions.md](rules/git.instructions.md) | Only `/nuc-proposal` (NUC allocations, claims and outcomes) and `/arc-purposal` (its own ARC changes, when it is done) commit and push; every agent pulls before it starts (fast-forward only, except those callers before a commit or push), pull before commit/push, push after every commit, resolve conflicts and push |
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Induced defect failure mode:
| [proposals.instructions.md](rules/proposals.instructions.md) | Independent NUC proposal preparation and evaluation, the token policy, automatic acceptance on the hard criteria (no compile errors, every test passing, backward compatibility) with the `Automatic-Accepted` status, ARC- and user-requested bases, the pushed `Draft NUC <number> <Title>` allocation of each new NUC before its details, after a pull that claims the next free number or skips a concept already proposed, and `NUC <number> <Title>` outcome commit messages |
| [git.instructions.md](rules/git.instructions.md) | Only `/nuc-proposal` (NUC allocations and outcomes) and `/arc-purposal` (its own ARC changes, when it is done) commit and push; every agent pulls before it starts (fast-forward only, except those callers before a commit or push), pull before commit/push, push after every commit, resolve conflicts and push |
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `41394de4` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
