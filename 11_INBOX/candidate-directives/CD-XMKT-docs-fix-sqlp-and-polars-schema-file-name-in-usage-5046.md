## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.claude/skills/qsv/qsv-joinp.json`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in dathere/qsv. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `ce4f6857`: docs: fix sqlp `<=>` and Polars schema file name in USAGE (#5046). Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.claude/skills/qsv/qsv-joinp.json`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
        "description": "Create and cache Polars schema JSON files. Ignored when --infer-len is 0. ‎ -2: treat all columns as String. A Polars schema file is created & cached. ‎ -1: treat all columns as String. No Polars schema file is created. ‎  0: do not cache Polars schema. Uses --infer-len to infer schema. ‎  1: cache Polars schema with the following behavior: * If schema file exists and is newer than input: use cached schema * If schema file missing/outdated and stats cache exists: derive schema from stats and cache it * If no schema or stats cache: infer schema using --infer-len and cache the result Schema files use the same name as input with .pschema.json extension (e.g., data.csv -> data.csv.pschema.json). ‎NOTE: If the input files have pschema.json files that are newer or created at the same time as the input files, they will be used to inform the join operation regardless of the value of --cache-schema unless --infer-len is 0.",
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
        "description": "Create and cache Polars schema JSON files. Ignored when --infer-len is 0. ‎ -2: treat all columns as String. A Polars schema file is created & cached. ‎ -1: treat all columns as String. No Polars schema file is created. ‎  0: do not cache Polars schema. Uses --infer-len to infer schema. ‎  1: cache Polars schema with the following behavior: * If schema file exists and is newer than input: use cached schema * If schema file missing/outdated and stats cache exists: derive schema from stats and cache it * If no schema or stats cache: infer schema using --infer-len and cache the result Schema files use the same name as input with .pschema.json extension (e.g., data.csv -> data.pschema.json). ‎NOTE: If the input files have pschema.json files that are newer or created at the same time as the input files, they will be used to inform the join operation regardless of the value of --cache-schema unless --infer-len is 0.",
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `ce4f6857` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
