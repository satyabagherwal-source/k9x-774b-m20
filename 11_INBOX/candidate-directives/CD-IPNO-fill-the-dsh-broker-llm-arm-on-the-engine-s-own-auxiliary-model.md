## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `STAGED_FOR_REVIEW`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Quarantined for review: Incomplete rule definition or ungrounded evidence ()
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain G

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `CHANGELOG.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in codewhale-hq/Codewhale. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `9b567b2b`: extension-host): fill the dsh/broker llm arm on the Engine's own auxiliary model call (CW-7973). Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `CHANGELOG.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
- **Plugin LLM broker arm (gated off):** adds the `dsh/broker` `llm` service arm (`catalog`, `complete`) and TypeScript SDK adapter, routing completions over the active session route with an isolated plugin prompt (omitting workspace instructions, account constitution, and other plugins' prompt sections), session permission-gate checks (`Read`/`Reach`), and bounded concurrency; host injection stays disabled by default pending final review. (CW-7973)
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Induced defect failure mode:
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `9b567b2b` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
