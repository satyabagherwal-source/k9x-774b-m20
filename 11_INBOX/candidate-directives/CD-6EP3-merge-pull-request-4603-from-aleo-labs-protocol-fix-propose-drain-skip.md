## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records; DIRECTIVE_OPPOSITION: Contradicts canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant): Opposing directive on 'write': candidate forbids action ('never write') while canonical Rule CANON-003 prescribes it ('always write'); CONTRADICTORY_CLAIM: Directly opposes canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant)
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain G

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `node/bft/src/primary.rs`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in aleo-labs-protocol/snarkOS. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `e3b97728`: Merge pull request #4603 from aleo-labs-protocol/fix/propose-drain-skip. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `node/bft/src/primary.rs`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
        // Fetch the current block height and consensus version.
        let current_block_height = self.ledger.latest_block_height();
        let consensus_version = N::CONSENSUS_VERSION(current_block_height)?;
        // Compute the batch proposal spend limit.
        let proposal_spend_limit = BatchHeader::<N>::batch_spend_limit(current_block_height)
            .saturating_mul(self.proposal_spent_limit_multiplier);

        // Note: a drained transmission is held only in `transmissions` or the local variables below,
        // so an early return (e.g. `?`) in this loop drops every transmission drained so far.
                        // Deserialize the transaction. If it is oversized or malformed, skip it.
                        let transaction = match spawn_blocking!(deserialize_transaction_strict(transaction)) {
                            Ok(transaction) => transaction,
                            Err(e) => {
                                debug!(
                                    "Proposing - Skipping and discarding transaction '{}' - Unable to deserialize transaction - {e}",
                                    fmt_id(transaction_id)
                                );
  
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
                        // Deserialize the transaction. If the transaction exceeds the maximum size, then return an error.
                        let transaction = spawn_blocking!(deserialize_transaction_strict(transaction))?;

                        // Fetch the current block height and consensus version.
                        let current_block_height = self.ledger.latest_block_height();
                        let consensus_version = N::CONSENSUS_VERSION(current_block_height)?;
                        let batch_spend_limit = BatchHeader::<N>::batch_spend_limit(current_block_height);
                        let proposal_spend_limit =
                            batch_spend_limit.saturating_mul(self.proposal_spent_limit_multiplier);
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `e3b97728` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
