## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: DIRECTIVE_OPPOSITION: Contradicts canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant): Opposing directive on 'write': candidate forbids action ('never write') while canonical Rule CANON-003 prescribes it ('always write'); CONTRADICTORY_CLAIM: Directly opposes canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant)
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain H

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.github/workflows/publish-release-assets.yml`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in meilisearch/meilisearch. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `1b782653`: Merge pull request #6734 from meilisearch/switch-macos-runner. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.github/workflows/publish-release-assets.yml`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
            os: macos-15
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
            os: macos-14
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `1b782653` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
