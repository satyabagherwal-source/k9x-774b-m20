## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `app/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/subject/episode/details/components/VideoEnhancementDropdown.kt`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in open-ani/animeko. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `51648f45`: player): prevent iOS video enhancement menu crash. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Kotlin data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `app/shared/src/commonMain/kotlin/ui/subject/episode/details/components/VideoEnhancementDropdown.kt`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```kotlin
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
import androidx.compose.foundation.layout.heightIn
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier,
        // Popup hosts can measure with unbounded height; the menu's scroll viewport must be finite.
        modifier = modifier.heightIn(max = 320.dp),
}
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```kotlin
// Induced defect failure mode:
}
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `51648f45` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
