## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain L

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `docker/Dockerfile`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in karakeep-app/karakeep. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `f7119ca0`: docker): pin Node.js to 24.22.3 for the November 2026 security release. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing TypeScript data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `docker/Dockerfile`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```typescript
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
# Pinned to an exact release so security fixes land deliberately instead of
# depending on whether a floating tag was re-pulled. Bump on every Node.js
# security release: https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability
ARG NODE_VERSION=24.22.3

FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-slim AS base
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-slim AS aio_builder
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-slim AS cli
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-slim AS mcp
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```typescript
// Induced defect failure mode:
FROM node:24-slim AS base
FROM node:24-slim AS aio_builder
FROM node:24-slim AS cli
FROM node:24-slim AS mcp
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `f7119ca0` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
