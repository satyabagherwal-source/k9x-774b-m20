## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`

- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain D

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in Bitterbot-AI/bitterbot-desktop. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `fdaddf50`: . Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing TypeScript data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```typescript
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
      - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@f87e5991a6d7451dcb8d9637bfbc97413f497069 # v4.4.1
      - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@f87e5991a6d7451dcb8d9637bfbc97413f497069 # v4.4.1
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```typescript
// Induced defect failure mode:
      - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@37fe631027851001ddb9b187196cc803df7f5f0e # v4.3.0
      - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@37fe631027851001ddb9b187196cc803df7f5f0e # v4.3.0
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `fdaddf50` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
