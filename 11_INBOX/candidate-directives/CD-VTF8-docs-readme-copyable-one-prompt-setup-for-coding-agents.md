## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `STAGED_FOR_REVIEW`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Quarantined for review: Incomplete rule definition or ungrounded evidence ()
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain I

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `README.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in i18next/react-i18next. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `f97f5f82`: docs(README): copyable one-prompt setup for coding agents. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing JavaScript data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `README.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```javascript
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
Working with a coding agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, ...)? Paste this prompt; the CLI prints the steps for its installed version, you review the diff, and the translation files stay in your repository unless you choose otherwise ([what the prompt tells your agent](https://www.i18next.com/how-to/ai-coding-agents)):

```text
Localize this app with i18next.
Run `npx i18next-cli localize --print-agent-prompt` and follow
the steps it prints, in order, checking each one before the next.
```

```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```javascript
// Induced defect failure mode:
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `f97f5f82` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
