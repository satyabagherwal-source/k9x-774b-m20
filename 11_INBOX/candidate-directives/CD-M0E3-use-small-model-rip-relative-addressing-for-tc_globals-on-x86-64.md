## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain H

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `tcmalloc/internal/config.h`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in google/tcmalloc. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `f69a26d2`: Use small-model RIP-relative addressing for tc_globals on x86-64.. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing C++ data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `tcmalloc/internal/config.h`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```c++
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
// GOOGLE_MALLOC_SECTION_BEGIN places globals in google_malloc_data /
// google_malloc_bss (normal small sections, not .ldata / .lbss), so
// RIP-relative small-model addressing is safe even under -mcmodel=medium when
// the object exceeds -mlarge-data-threshold.
#if defined(__clang__) && defined(__linux__) && defined(__x86_64__) && \
    ABSL_HAVE_ATTRIBUTE(model)
#define TCMALLOC_SMALL_MODEL __attribute__((model("small")))
#else
#define TCMALLOC_SMALL_MODEL
#endif

```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```c++
// Induced defect failure mode:
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `f69a26d2` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
