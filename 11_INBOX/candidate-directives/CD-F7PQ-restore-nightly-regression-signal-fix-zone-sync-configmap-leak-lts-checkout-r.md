## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `STAGED_FOR_REVIEW`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Quarantined for review: Incomplete rule definition or ungrounded evidence ()
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain K

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.github/actions/smoke-tests/action.yaml`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in nginx/kubernetes-ingress. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `afb4fa83`: Restore nightly regression signal: fix zone-sync ConfigMap leak, LTS checkout, run past first failure. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.github/actions/smoke-tests/action.yaml`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
  pytest-args:
    description: Extra pytest arguments, e.g. --maxfail=100 to keep running after the first failure
    required: false
        ${{ inputs.pytest-args }} \
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```go
// Induced defect failure mode:
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `afb4fa83` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
