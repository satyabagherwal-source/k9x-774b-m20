## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: DIRECTIVE_OPPOSITION: Contradicts canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant): Opposing directive on 'write': candidate forbids action ('never write') while canonical Rule CANON-003 prescribes it ('always write'); CONTRADICTORY_CLAIM: Directly opposes canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant)
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain H

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `src/parallel/runtime_filter_schedule.cpp`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in duckdb/duckdb. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `5c8008b4`: Order small runtime filter builds before filtered and nested scans (#28768). Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing C++ data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `src/parallel/runtime_filter_schedule.cpp`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```c++
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
static bool IsSmallBuild(const PhysicalOperator &op) {
	if (op.estimated_cardinality > DEFAULT_STANDARD_VECTOR_SIZE || op.IsSink()) {
		return false;
	}
	for (auto &child : op.children) {
		if (!IsSmallBuild(child.get())) {
			return false;
		}
	}
	return true;
}

	struct FilterSource {
		idx_t stage_idx;
		bool small_build_only;
	};
	reference_map_t<DynamicTableFilterSet, vector<FilterSource>> sources;
		const auto small_build_only =
		    join_build_stages[stage_idx] ||
		    (scan.table_filters && (scan.table_filters->HasFilters() || scan.table_filters->HasMultiColumnFilters()));
		sources[*scan.dynamic_filters].push_back({stage_idx, small_build_only});
			sources[filters.get()].push_back({stage_idx, false});
		const auto small_build = add_edges && IsSmallBuild(producer.children[1].get());
			for (auto &filter_source : source->second) {
				// A small aggregate or join result can still require expensive inputs.
				if (filter_source.small_build_only && !small_build) {
					continue;
				}
				auto execution = filter_source.stage_idx;
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```c++
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
	reference_map_t<DynamicTableFilterSet, vector<idx_t>> sources;
		if (!join_build_stages[stage_idx] && (!scan.table_filters || (!scan.table_filters->HasFilters() &&
		                                                              !scan.table_filters->HasMultiColumnFilters()))) {
			sources[*scan.dynamic_filters].push_back(stage_idx);
		}
			sources[filters.get()].push_back(stage_idx);
			for (auto execution : source->second) {
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `5c8008b4` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
