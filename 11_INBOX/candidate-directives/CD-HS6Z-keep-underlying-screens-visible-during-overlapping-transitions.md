- **Candidate Domain**: Domain G

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `packages/stack/src/views/Stack/CardStack.tsx`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in react-navigation/react-navigation. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `5e31b0a0`: keep underlying screens visible during overlapping transitions. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing TypeScript data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `packages/stack/src/views/Stack/CardStack.tsx`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```typescript
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
                  // The screen below an opening card can still be visible during overlapping pushes
                  (nextRoute != null &&
                    openingRouteKeys.includes(nextRoute.key)) ||
              focused || (isFocusing && !isRemoving)
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```typescript
// Induced defect failure mode:
              focused || isFocusing
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `5e31b0a0` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
