## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain G

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in skyhook-io/radar. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `148a70c8`: Linux desktop packaging with verified nfpm 2.49.0 binary. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
        env:
          NFPM_VERSION: '2.49.0'
          NFPM_SHA256: '2afaa5ffb5e3493402e31e7c67a5a1fb42133e3f66fc315ca0051934125561c7'
        run: |
          curl --fail --location --retry 3 --output "$RUNNER_TEMP/nfpm.tar.gz" \
            "https://github.com/goreleaser/nfpm/releases/download/v${NFPM_VERSION}/nfpm_${NFPM_VERSION}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz"
          echo "${NFPM_SHA256}  $RUNNER_TEMP/nfpm.tar.gz" | sha256sum --check --strict
          mkdir -p "$RUNNER_TEMP/nfpm-bin"
          tar -xzf "$RUNNER_TEMP/nfpm.tar.gz" -C "$RUNNER_TEMP/nfpm-bin" nfpm
          echo "$RUNNER_TEMP/nfpm-bin" >> "$GITHUB_PATH"
          "$RUNNER_TEMP/nfpm-bin/nfpm" --version
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```go
// Induced defect failure mode:
        run: go install github.com/goreleaser/nfpm/v2/cmd/nfpm@latest
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `148a70c8` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
