## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `STAGED_FOR_REVIEW`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Quarantined for review: Incomplete rule definition or ungrounded evidence ()
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain G

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `src/cmd/json.rs`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in dathere/qsv. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `b0d8deec`: clippy::unnecessary-to-owned. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `src/cmd/json.rs`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
            .all(|&h| actual_headers.iter().any(|i| i == h))
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Induced defect failure mode:
            .all(|&h| actual_headers.contains(&h.to_string()))
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `b0d8deec` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
