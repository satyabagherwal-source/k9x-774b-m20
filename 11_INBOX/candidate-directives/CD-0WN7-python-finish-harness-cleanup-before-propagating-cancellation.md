## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `sdk/python/agentfield/harness/_cli.py`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in Agent-Field/agentfield. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `0145089a`: python): finish harness cleanup before propagating cancellation. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `sdk/python/agentfield/harness/_cli.py`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
    except (asyncio.TimeoutError, TimeoutError, asyncio.CancelledError):
        # Loop shutdown cancels the cleanup task too. Finish the same bounded
        # kill/poll fallback; run_cli still propagates the caller's cancellation.
        try:
            await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
        except asyncio.CancelledError:
            # Do not restart the polling budget when shutdown cancels again.
            pass

        async def cleanup() -> Optional[int]:
            if not completed:
                _kill_group()
            drain.cancel()
            try:
                await drain
            except BaseException:
                pass
            return await _wait_process_exit(proc, _kill_group)

        # Pipe EOF does not mean the child has exited. Keep ownership until
        # the bounded exit wait finishes, even if cancellation arrives here
        # or is repeated while cleanup is already running.
        cleanup_task = asyncio.create_task(cleanup())
        cleanup_cancelled: Optional[asyncio.CancelledError] = None
        while True:
            try:
                fallback_returncode = await asyncio.shield(cleanup_task)
                break
            except asy
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```go
// Induced defect failure mode:
    except (asyncio.TimeoutError, TimeoutError):
        await asyncio.sleep(0.1)
