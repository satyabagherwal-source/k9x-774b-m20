## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: DIRECTIVE_OPPOSITION: Contradicts canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant): Opposing directive on 'write': candidate forbids action ('never write') while canonical Rule CANON-003 prescribes it ('always write'); CONTRADICTORY_CLAIM: Directly opposes canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant)
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain G

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `crates/core/src/simulation/time.rs`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in freenet/freenet-core. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `f26a5e1f`: test): a lost VirtualTime wakeup and drive_on_threads advancing over busy workers (#6223). Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `crates/core/src/simulation/time.rs`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
        // One atomic step, so two threads advancing at once cannot move the
        // clock backwards (a load then a store could store the smaller
        // target last). The time is stored before `pending_wakeups` is taken
        // below, which `register_future_wakeup` relies on.
        let previous = self
            .state
            .current_nanos
            .fetch_max(target_nanos, AtomicOrdering::SeqCst);
        if target_nanos <= previous {
    /// Registers a wakeup and returns its ID, whatever its deadline. Tests
    /// only; sleeps use [`Self::register_future_wakeup`].
    #[cfg(test)]
    /// Registers a wakeup for `deadline` if it is still in the future, and
    /// returns its ID; `None` if the clock has already reached it.
    ///
    /// The check and the push are one step under the `pending_wakeups` lock.
    /// [`Self::advance_to`] stores the new time before it takes that lock to
    /// pop expired wakeups, so a registration either sees the new time (and
    /// registers nothing) or is pushed before the pop (and is popped). Checked
    /// outside the lock, a thread that read the time just before another
    /// thread's advance could push a wakeup the
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
        let current = self.state.current_nanos.load(AtomicOrdering::SeqCst);
        if target_nanos <= current {
        self.state
            .current_nanos
            .store(target_nanos, AtomicOrdering::SeqCst);

    /// Registers a wakeup and returns its ID.
        let current = self.now_nanos();
        if deadline_nanos <= current {
        }

        let id = self.register_wakeup(deadline_nanos);
        if deadline <= self.now_nanos() {
        }
        let id = self.register_wakeup(deadline);
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `f26a5e1f` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
