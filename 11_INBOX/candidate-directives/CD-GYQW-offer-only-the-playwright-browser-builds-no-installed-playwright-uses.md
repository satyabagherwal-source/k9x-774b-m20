## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain G

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `PurgeTests/AllowlistAuditTests.swift`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in jithin-sabu/purge-app. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `0385710d`: offer only the Playwright browser builds no installed Playwright uses. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Swift data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `PurgeTests/AllowlistAuditTests.swift`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```swift
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
        "SBT Cache", "Unused Playwright Browsers",
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```swift
// Induced defect failure mode:
        "SBT Cache", "Playwright Browsers",
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `0385710d` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
