## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `pkg/config/diagnosticmode/mode_server_test.go`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in pingcap/tidb. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `7a158c6a`: config: recognize runtime exit tails in diagnostic goroutine profiles. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `pkg/config/diagnosticmode/mode_server_test.go`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
		if !hasFrames || isRuntimeGoexitGroup(groupHeader) {
			// A goroutine can be sampled after its user function has returned,
			// in runtime.goexit or runtime.goexit1. debug=1 hides runtime.goexit.
			// Resolve every raw PC so only runtime exit stacks bypass the allowlist.
		if (frame.Function != "runtime.goexit" && frame.Function != "runtime.goexit1") || more {
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```go
// Induced defect failure mode:
		if !hasFrames {
			// debug=1 suppresses runtime.goexit even when it is the only frame.
			// Resolve the raw PCs so no other frameless stack escapes the allowlist.
		if frame.Function != "runtime.goexit" || more {
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `7a158c6a` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
