## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `STAGED_FOR_REVIEW`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Quarantined for review: Incomplete rule definition or ungrounded evidence ()
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain D

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `pkg/sources/stdin/README.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in trufflesecurity/trufflehog. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `94dd9889`: Clean up Stdin source logging for per-source debug. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `pkg/sources/stdin/README.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
When the limit is hit, input not scanned by then is dropped, and the scan reports the error `stdin input was not fully scanned: it took longer than the --archive-timeout limit`. Like other scan errors, it only makes TruffleHog exit with a non-zero code when `--fail-on-scan-errors` is set. This matters for streams that never end on their own, like `docker logs -f` or `tail -f`.
