## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `docs/manual/update-guides/1.12.8.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in beclab/Olares. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `7a4e4a4d`: docs: clarify 1.12.8 upgrade guide. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Go data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `docs/manual/update-guides/1.12.8.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```go
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
description: Prepare for Olares 1.12.8 with guidance on device activation, GPU app restarts, Files permissions, and changes to host terminal access.
Olares 1.12.8 introduces several changes to system setup and workflows.

This guide explains what changed in 1.12.8, whether you need to take action, and where to find the detailed steps.
| You use Control Hub to access the Olares host terminal. | The host terminal entry has been removed. Use an alternative access method. [View details](#access-the-host-terminal-after-updating). |
