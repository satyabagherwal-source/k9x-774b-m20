## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records; DIRECTIVE_OPPOSITION: Contradicts canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant): Opposing directive on 'write': candidate forbids action ('never write') while canonical Rule CANON-003 prescribes it ('always write'); CONTRADICTORY_CLAIM: Directly opposes canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant)
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.github/workflows/ecosystem-qa.yml`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in storybookjs/storybook. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `c36d09d2`: ecosystem-qa): redact the run result in a step of its own, also after a crash. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing TypeScript data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.github/workflows/ecosystem-qa.yml`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```typescript
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
      # run.ts redacts its output when it reaches its end. A run that crashed or was cancelled did
      # not, and the upload publishes whatever is there.
      - name: Redact credentials in the run result
        id: redact
        run: node ecosystem-qa/redact.ts ecosystem-qa/results

      - name: Upload the run result
        if: ${{ always() && steps.redact.outcome == 'success' }}
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```typescript
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
      - name: Upload the run result
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `c36d09d2` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
