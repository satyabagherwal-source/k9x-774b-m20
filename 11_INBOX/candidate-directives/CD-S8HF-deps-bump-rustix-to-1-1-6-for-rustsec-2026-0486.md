## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records; DIRECTIVE_OPPOSITION: Contradicts canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant): Opposing directive on 'write': candidate forbids action ('never write') while canonical Rule CANON-003 prescribes it ('always write'); CONTRADICTORY_CLAIM: Directly opposes canonical rule RULE-CANON-003 (Atomic Persistence File Staging Invariant)
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain H

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `rust/Cargo.lock`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in kucherenko/jscpd. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `89715b34`: deps): bump rustix to 1.1.6 for RUSTSEC-2026-0486. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `rust/Cargo.lock`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
 "windows-sys 0.52.0",
version = "1.1.6"
checksum = "e5e76742e5294153d4dde1207dbec5bdd81eef6fabdc0d2118babadabfd858aa"
 "windows-sys 0.52.0",
 "windows-sys 0.52.0",
 "windows-sys 0.52.0",
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Anti-pattern to NEVER write (induced failure mode):
 "windows-sys 0.61.2",
version = "1.1.5"
checksum = "891efababe418670775f199f0d233d84843c227a0949a883ce15b37c78d6629d"
 "windows-sys 0.61.2",
 "windows-sys 0.61.2",
 "windows-sys 0.61.2",
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `89715b34` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
