## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `STAGED_FOR_REVIEW`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Quarantined for review: Incomplete rule definition or ungrounded evidence ()
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain I

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `REVIEW.md`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in yugabyte/yugabyte-db. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `a7a0e327`: [PLAT-23867] Add AI review guide for YBA. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing C data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `REVIEW.md`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```c
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
- Under `managed/`, what [`managed/REVIEW.md`](managed/REVIEW.md) asks to flag.
- **`managed/`** (YBA platform) — orchestration logic, especially around node lifecycle and cluster-wide ops. See [`managed/REVIEW.md`](managed/REVIEW.md).
```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```c
// Induced defect failure mode:
- **`managed/`** (YBA platform) — orchestration logic, especially around node lifecycle and cluster-wide ops.
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `a7a0e327` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
