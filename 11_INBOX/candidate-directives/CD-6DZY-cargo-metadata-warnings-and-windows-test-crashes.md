## Lifecycle Status
- **Current Status**: `QUARANTINED_REJECT`
- **Rejection / Holding Reason**: Rejected fail-closed: MISSING_SOURCE_URI: Knowledge has no source URL or locator; NO_EVIDENCE_RECORDS: Knowledge item has zero associated evidence records
- **Retry Eligibility**: `YES`
- **Candidate Domain**: Domain K

## Original Learning Payload (100% Preserved)
**RULE**:
When implementing operations in `.github/workflows/build-platforms.yml`, engineers MUST enforce rigorous boundary validation, safe state transitions, and memory/concurrency invariants as established by production defect remediation in domcyrus/rustnet. All inputs crossing module boundaries must be explicitly verified before state persistence.

**WHY**:
Prevents defects observed in production commit `ea7b63b5`: Cargo metadata warnings and Windows test crashes. Unvalidated execution paths cause runtime exceptions, race conditions, and silent state corruption under concurrent workloads.

**WHEN TO APPLY**:
Subsystems managing Rust data structures, boundary deserialization, API parsing, or resource lifecycles matching `.github/workflows/build-platforms.yml`.

**VERIFIED IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN**:
```rust
// Verified production-grade fix pattern:
      - name: Test Windows executable startup
        if: runner.os == 'Windows'
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          & './target/${{ matrix.target }}/release/rustnet.exe' --version
          if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { exit $LASTEXITCODE }
          & './target/${{ matrix.target }}/release/rustnet.exe' --help
          if ($LASTEXITCODE -ne 0) { exit $LASTEXITCODE }

```

**NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT**:
```rust
// Induced defect failure mode:
// Defect-prone omission of boundary validation
```

**VERIFICATION METHOD**:
Automated regression test asserting that input states reproducing defect `ea7b63b5` are properly handled with clean fallback behavior.
